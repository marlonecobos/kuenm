\title{Extrapolation risk analysis for single comparisons}
\usage{
kuenm_mop(M.stack, G.stack, percent = 10, comp.each = 2000, parallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{M.stack}{a RasterStack of variables representing the calibration area.}

\item{G.stack}{a RasterStack of variables representing the full area of interest, and areas
or scenarios to which models are transferred.}

\item{percent}{(numeric) percent of values sampled from te calibration region to calculate the MOP.}

\item{comp.each}{(numeric) compute distance matrix for a each fixed number of rows (default = 2000).}

\item{parallel}{(logical) if TRUE, calculations will be performed in parallel using the available
cores of the computer. This will demand more RAM and almost full use of the CPU; hence, its use
is more recommended in high-performance computers. Using this option will speed up the analyses.
Default = FALSE.}
}
\value{
A mobility-oriented parity RasterLayer where values of 0 represent strict extrapolation,
which means complete dissimilarity of environments between the calibration (M) and projection area (G).
}
\description{
kuenm_mop calculates a mobility-oriented parity layer by
comparing environmental values between the calibration area and the area or
scenario to which an ecological niche model is transferred.
}
\details{
The MOP is calculated following Owens et al.
(2013; \url{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2013.04.011}). This function is a modification
of the \code{\link[ENMGadgets]{MOP}} funcion, available at \url{https://github.com/narayanibarve/ENMGadgets}.
